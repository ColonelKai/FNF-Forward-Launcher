There are a few ways to contribute to the project. 

The first way is just creating a feature request or bug report within the "Issues" tab. Your "issue" will be looked at. 

If you are more of the hands on sort, then you can contribute by modifing the code to your liking. To do this follow the step by step

- Fork the project
- Clone your forked project
- Modify the code to your liking
- commit and push your changes to your fork
- make a "Pull request" on this project with your changes

any PR's will be reviewed, changes maybe asked for to your code making it the standard expected from this project.

Thanks
